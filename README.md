# A simple task management web app

This was built with Vite create react app.

If you prefer not to set up the project locally, you can access the hosted version of the Task Management Web App at https://tm-test-henna.vercel.app/. This allows you to explore the app without going through the process of running it on your local machine. So you can check it out there!

# Setting Up the Task Management Web App Locally
To run the Task Management Web App on your local machine, follow these steps:

Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following software installed on your system:

Node.js (version 14 or higher)
Yarn

# Installation
Clone the Repository:

Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to store the project. Then, clone the repository.

Navigate to the Project Directory:

Move into the project directory you just finished cloning

Install the project dependencies using Yarn:

yarn install

# Running the Development Server
Now that you've installed the necessary dependencies, you can start the development server and run the app locally.

yarn dev
This will launch the development server. You should see output indicating that the app is being compiled and the server is running. By default, the app should be accessible at http://localhost:5173 or it may differ.

Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5173 to view the Task Management Web App in action!
